Three Card Monte

For the upcoming assignment, the task involves collaborating in pairs. 
It's worth mentioning that only one student from each pair is required to submit the final work. 
To simplify the submission, please organize your work by creating a zip file and then proceed to submit it. 
Inside the zip file, ensure the inclusion of two specific files: your solution.py file and "check_input.py".
